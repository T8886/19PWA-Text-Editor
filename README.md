## Description:
19PWA-Text-Editor is text editor that runs in the browser. The app is a single-page application that meets the PWA criteria. Additionally, it does feature a number of data persistence techniques that serve as redundancy in case one of the options is not supported by the browser. The application also functions offline. App was created with the help of tutors and class activities from module 19.

WHEN I open application in editor THEN I should see a client server folder structure.
WHEN I run `npm run start` from the root directory THEN I find that application should start up the backend and serve the client.
WHEN I run the text editor application from terminal THEN I find that my JavaScript files have been bundled using webpack.
WHEN I run webpack plugins THEN I find that I have a generated HTML file, service worker, and a manifest file.
WHEN I use next-gen JavaScript in my application THEN I find that the text editor still functions in the browser without errors.
WHEN I open the text editor THEN I find that IndexedDB has immediately created a database storage.
WHEN I enter content and subsequently click off of the DOM window THEN I find that the content in the text editor has been saved with IndexedDB.
WHEN I reopen the text editor after closing it THEN I find that the content in the text editor has been retrieved from our IndexedDB.
WHEN I click on the Install button THEN I download web application as an icon on desktop.
WHEN I load web application THEN I should have a registered service worker using workbox
WHEN I register a service worker THEN I should have static assets pre cached upon loading along with subsequent pages and static assets.
WHEN I deploy to Heroku THEN I should have proper build scripts for a webpack application.
